This page describes the internal architecture of this server.  It is not necessary to know
or understand this material in order to simply use the system.
<P>
This server consists of six Docker containers in total.
<P>
There are two data containers:
<UL>
<LI>a data container containing the NG-CHMs uploaded to the system, and
<LI>a data container containing a database of read-only linkout definitions.
</UL>
There are three 'backend' server containers:
<UL>
<LI>an NG-CHM viewer container,
<LI>an NG-CHM manager container,
<LI>a DyCE container for creating content-specific linkouts.
</UL>
The three backend server containers are connected to a private (internal) Docker network.
<P>
The final container implements a reverse-proxy server with a published interface on a public
network.  The reverse proxy container is also connected to the private network and forwards
client requests to the appropriate 'backend' container.
